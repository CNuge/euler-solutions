# euler-solutions
This repository contains my solutions to the practice problems at projecteuler.net that I have been solving. 
I've been solving these in a mix of go and python (whatever I'm feeling like at the time). 
Solved problems are found in the `go_answers` and `py_answers` folder. As I pick new problems I make a file and place it in the TODO
folder, anything I'm currently working on will be in the main directory.
