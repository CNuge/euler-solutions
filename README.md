# euler-solutions
## This repository contains my solutions to some problems from [projecteuler.net](projecteuler.net)
- I've been solving these in a mix of go and python (whatever I'm feeling like at the time). 
- Solved problems are found in the `go_answers` and `py_answers` folder. 
- As I pick new problems I make a file and place it in the TODO folder. 
- Anything I'm currently working on will be in the main directory.
