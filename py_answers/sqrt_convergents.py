"""
My initial solution for this was very literal... and wrong as a result.
I left it commented out at the bottom as it is a good reminder of how I
incorrectly approached the problem... I then looked up the proper formula
for the calculation of the next numerator and denominator (missed this pattern)
and then was able to arrive at the proper solution.

It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed 
as an infinite continued fraction.

âˆš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...

By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...
1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...

The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, 
but the eighth expansion, 1393/985, is the first example where the 
number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.

In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a 
numerator with more digits than denominator?
